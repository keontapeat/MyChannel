Subject: URGENT: Firebase Hosting API 404 Error on Finalize - Production Blocking Issue (Google for Startups Member)

Dear Will,

Hope you're doing well! As my new Google Cloud contact for the GFS Program, I need your urgent assistance with a critical production issue that's blocking my MyChannel app deployments.

I am a member of the Google for Startups Cloud Program and am experiencing a critical production-blocking issue with Firebase Hosting that requires immediate attention.

ISSUE SUMMARY:
Firebase Hosting deployments are failing consistently with a 404 error during the version finalization step. This started on August 22, 2025, and affects my ability to deploy updates to my live production website.

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Project ID: mychannel-ca26d
- Firebase CLI Version: 14.13.0
- Node.js Version: v20.19.4
- Environment: macOS 15.6
- Google for Startups Program Member: Yes
- Billing Account: 01987B-896185-140D6D (with active $2,000 startup credits)

ERROR PATTERN:
1. File upload completes successfully (5,200+ files)
2. Finalization step fails with HTTP 404 error
3. Specific API endpoint failing: https://firebasehosting.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/-/sites/mychannel-ca26d/versions/[VERSION_ID]?updateMask=status%2Cconfig

EXACT ERROR MESSAGE:
"Error: Request to https://firebasehosting.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/-/sites/mychannel-ca26d/versions/14318d6ebd705967?updateMask=status%2Cconfig had HTTP Error: 404, Requested entity was not found."

TIMELINE:
- August 21, 2025: Deployments working normally
- August 22, 2025: All deployments failing at finalize step
- Present: Issue persists consistently

TROUBLESHOOTING ATTEMPTED:
- Tested with multiple Node.js versions (18, 20, 22)
- Reinstalled firebase-tools CLI
- Attempted preview channel deployments
- Tried minimal file deployments
- Verified authentication and project configuration
- All approaches fail at the same finalization API endpoint

BUSINESS IMPACT:
- Cannot deploy critical updates to production website (mychannel.live)
- New features ready but blocked from release
- Live site serving outdated version

This appears to be a Firebase API regression that occurred between August 21-22, 2025. The consistent pattern of successful uploads followed by 404 errors on finalization suggests an issue with Firebase's hosting API infrastructure.

As a Google for Startups program member, I would appreciate priority assistance in resolving this production-blocking issue. The problem affects my ability to maintain and update my live application.

Please escalate this to the Firebase engineering team for immediate investigation.

Thank you for your urgent attention to this matter.

Thanks for your help with this urgent matter!
